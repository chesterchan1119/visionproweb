# Pose Detection by using Mediapipe
Run real-time pose estimation in the browser using Mediapipe Library can be used to estimate either a single pose or multiple poses, meaning there is a version of the algorithm that can detect only one person in an image/video and one version that can detect multiple persons in an image/video.

This is a Pure Mediapipe Library implementation of PoseNet. Thank you Google for your flexible and intuitive APIs.
